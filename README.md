# INFINITE TIC-TAC-TOE:
This is a version of Tic-Tac-Toe made with simple pygame instructions.

## How to play?:
Click to put a X/O where you want.
When a player has put 3 X/O, the next one will erase the first of this 3 X/O.
<br>
For exemple, the next image shows a situation where the first player (O) has the turn, and he has put the first O in the middle:
![BlueIsGoingToWin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5622d0df-c659-4a1a-baa8-f4e2e1b51c7f)
</br>
But if the first player (O) places the next O under the middle one, this will disappear:
![BlueIsNoWin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed02db75-9c8a-48c8-b5dc-03d3fa8e7c6e)
<br>
The first to line up 3 X/O wins!
